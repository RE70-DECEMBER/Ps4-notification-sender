this was made in c# in visual studio using the ps4debug dll 
this was tested on a 64bit windows 10 laptop and works 
a jailbroken ps4 with goldhen is required to be able to use this 
I think it will work on all firmwares but I tested it on 9.00
make sure to enable the debug payload on your ps4 before using this
